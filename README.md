## :rocket: Getting started

-  Before you start development on this project, run the prep target. This will install a hook that would check your commit for code formatting issues.

   ```shell
   make prep
   ```

-  Run the application in dev mode that enables live coding. Quarkus dev UI would be accessible at [http://127.0.0.1:8080/q/dev-ui/welcome](http://127.0.0.1:8080/q/dev-ui/welcome).

   ```shell
   make dev
   ```

-  To format the code, enable [google-java-format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) and in your IDE and turn on the auto-formatting on save. You may also run spotless plugin manually.

   ```shell
   make format
   ```

## :package: Packaging and running

1. Build the application

   ```shell
   make build

   # OR

   make container-build
   ```

1. Run the application

   ```shell
   make run

   # OR

   make container-run
   ```
