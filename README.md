# Quarkus Template

A starter template for writing backend application using [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/), the supersonic-subatomic framework for Java.

> [!NOTE]
> This is not a full-blown backend application written in Quarkus, rather just enough to get started with a new project with some useful extensions and properties configured that are suitable for my own needs.
